# Animal-Fun-Facts

We build a program with React that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up. Our program displays a selection of animals on the screen. 
Clicking an animal causes a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact pops up on the screen. As we keep clicking, we are able to see different facts.
